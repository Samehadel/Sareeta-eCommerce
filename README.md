# Sareeta-eCommerce

This project has a weak business logic because this isn't a real project. Instead, this project built to demonstrate some skills in the following areas:

* Using Spring Security and JWT to authenticate and authorize users.
* Use Junit and Mockito to build unit tests.
* Use Splunk to monitor the application logs and built alerts to be updated with the real-time state of the application usage.
* Use Junkis, Docker and AWS to build pipeline and deploy the application.
